      {
        q: "How is UK income tax calculated for 2024/25?",
        a: "UK income tax is calculated using progressive tax bands: 0% on income up to £12,570 (personal allowance), 20% on income from £12,571 to £50,270 (basic rate), 40% on income from £50,271 to £125,140 (higher rate), and 45% on income above £125,140 (additional rate). Scotland has different rates and bands."
      },
      {
        q: "What is National Insurance and how much do I pay?",
        a: "National Insurance (NI) funds state benefits like the NHS and state pension. For 2024/25: you pay 12% on earnings between £12,570-£50,270, and 2% on earnings above £50,270. Self-employed pay Class 2 (£3.45/week if profits >£6,515) and Class 4 (9% on profits £12,570-£50,270, 2% above)."
      },
      {
        q: "When does my personal allowance reduce?",
        a: "Your £12,570 personal allowance reduces by £1 for every £2 of income above £100,000. It's completely removed when your income reaches £125,140, creating an effective 60% tax rate between £100,000-£125,140."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Student Loans",
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "How are student loan repayments calculated?",
        a: "Repayments depend on your loan plan: Plan 1 (pre-2012): 9% on income above £22,015. Plan 2 (2012-2023): 9% on income above £27,295. Plan 5 (post-2023): 9% on income above £25,000. Postgraduate loans: 6% on income above £21,000. Multiple plans can apply simultaneously."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I pay off my student loan early?",
        a: "Yes, but consider the interest rate vs other investments. Plan 1 loans use RPI or Bank of England base rate +1% (whichever is lower). Plan 2/5 use RPI +3% while studying, then RPI + 0-3% based on income. Many loans are written off after 25-30 years."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Pensions & Benefits",
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "How do pension contributions affect my tax?",
        a: "Pension contributions receive tax relief: 20% for basic rate taxpayers, 40% for higher rate, 45% for additional rate. The annual allowance is £60,000 (2024/25), but tapers for high earners. Salary sacrifice schemes can also save National Insurance."
      },
      {
        q: "What are the benefits of salary sacrifice?",
        a: "Salary sacrifice reduces both income tax and National Insurance. Common schemes include pensions, cycle-to-work, electric cars, and childcare vouchers. Your gross salary reduces, but take-home pay often increases due to tax savings."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Self-Employment",
    faqs: [
      {
        q: "How is self-employed tax calculated?",
        a: "Self-employed pay income tax on profits (same rates as employed), Class 2 NI (£3.45/week if profits >£6,515), and Class 4 NI (9% on profits £12,570-£50,270, 2% above). You can deduct business expenses and claim allowances like home office costs."
      },
      {
        q: "What expenses can I claim as self-employed?",
        a: "You can claim expenses 'wholly and exclusively' for business: office costs, travel, equipment, professional fees, insurance, marketing, and training. Home office costs can be claimed using simplified flat rates or actual costs method."

        a: "Our calculator uses the latest HMRC rates and is updated for 2024/25. It covers most common scenarios but may not account for complex situations like split-year treatment, non-dom status, or specific reliefs. Always consult a qualified advisor for major financial decisions."

        a: "No. This calculator processes everything in your browser - no data is sent to our servers, stored, or shared. We use privacy-friendly analytics to improve the service but cannot see your personal calculations."
