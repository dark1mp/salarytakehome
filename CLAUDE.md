## Calculators (10 total)

| Calculator | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Take Home Pay | `/take-home-pay-calculator` | Main calculator — highest traffic page |
| Pay Rise | `/pay-rise` | Before/after pay rise comparison |
| Hourly Wage | `/hourly-wage` | Hourly to annual conversion with tax |
| Compare Salaries | `/compare-salaries` | Side-by-side salary comparison |
| Two Jobs | `/two-jobs` | Multiple employment tax calculator |
| Pro-Rata | `/pro-rata-furlough` | Part-time / pro-rata salary |
| Sick Pay | `/sick-pay` | Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) |
| Maternity Pay | `/maternity-sick-pay` | Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) |
| Mortgages | `/mortgages` | Mortgage repayment calculator |
| Debts | `/debts` | Debt repayment calculator |

All calculators support:
- Multiple tax years (2025/26, 2024/25, 2023/24, 2022/23, 2021/22)
- Scottish tax rates (separate bands)
- Student loan plans (1, 2, 4, 5, Postgraduate)
- Pension contributions
- Tax code customisation

## Tax Data

Tax bands, NI thresholds, and student loan thresholds are defined inline in each calculator's `page.js`. Key values for 2025/26:
- Personal Allowance: £12,570
- Basic rate (20%): up to £50,270
- Higher rate (40%): up to £125,140
- Additional rate (45%): above £125,140
- NI rate: 8% (reduced from 10% in 2024/25)
- Scottish rates: 5 bands from 19% to 46%

## Blog

20 blog posts across categories: Salary Guide, Tax Planning, Pensions, Student Loans, Savings & ISAs. Includes "vs" comparison posts (Scottish tax vs English tax, Plan 1 vs Plan 2, salary sacrifice vs personal pension) which target high-intent search queries.

### Adding a New Blog Post

1. Create `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.js`
2. Wrap content in `<LayoutWrapper breadcrumbs={[{ name: "Home", href: "/" }, { name: "Blog", href: "/blog" }, { name: "Post Title" }]}>` — this provides sidebar, footer, and breadcrumbs automatically
3. Add the post to the blog index in `src/app/blog/page.js`
4. Add the URL to `src/app/sitemap.js` (update blog lastModified date too)
5. Cross-link to relevant calculators (hourly-wage, take-home-pay-calculator, pay-rise)
6. Add external links to official sources (.gov.uk, HMRC, SLC etc.) for E-E-A-T credibility
7. Include structured data: Article schema + FAQPage (if applicable). BreadcrumbList schema is handled by the Breadcrumbs component automatically.
8. Add RelatedArticles component at the bottom
9. After deploy, IndexNow submission happens automatically via postbuild script

## SEO Checklist

- Every page needs: title, description, canonical URL, Open Graph tags, Twitter card
- Structured data: WebApplication (root), Article (blog posts), FAQPage (where relevant)
- Sitemap: dynamic at `/sitemap.js` — must be updated when adding/removing pages
- Robots.txt: blocks `/api/`, `/_next/`, `/admin/`
- IndexNow: auto-submits all sitemap URLs post-build to Bing, Yandex, Seznam, Naver. Can also be triggered manually: `node scripts/submit-indexnow.mjs`
- Google: does NOT support IndexNow. Google sitemap ping endpoint is deprecated (returns 404). Use Google Search Console for manual URL submission, or rely on Google crawling the sitemap `<lastmod>` dates.
- Breadcrumbs: every page has visual breadcrumbs + BreadcrumbList JSON-LD schema via the Breadcrumbs component
- **Last Updated badge:** all 10 calculator pages show "Last updated: January 2026 · Reflects 2025/26 tax year" below the h1 description. Update this when tax data changes.
- **Related Reading:** all calculator pages have a Related Reading section at the bottom linking to relevant blog posts. When adding new blog posts, consider updating these links.
- **Internal linking:** calculators link to blog posts (Related Reading sections), blog posts link back to calculators (inline CTAs). Both directions matter for SEO.
- Google Search Console verified, Bing Webmaster verified
- Non-www redirects to www

## Styling Conventions

- **Primary colour:** #1566a0 (blue)
- **Gradients:** blue-to-indigo for headers/CTAs (`from-blue-600 to-indigo-700`)
- **Cards:** white background, rounded-2xl, shadow-lg, hover lift effects
- **Layout:** sidebar navigation on desktop, hamburger menu on mobile (`fixed bottom-20 left-4` — positioned above AdSense anchor ads)
- **Font:** Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Responsive:** mobile-first, Tailwind breakpoints

## Performance

- Inline CSS enabled (experimental Next.js feature)
- Images: WebP + AVIF formats
- Scripts: analytics loaded with `lazyOnload`, ads with `afterInteractive`
- Static assets: 1-year cache headers
- Compression enabled
- Security headers: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection
- Preconnects to Google Ad Manager and Tag Manager

## Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — optional, for AI chatbot feature (not currently active)
- No other env vars required — all config is in source

## Key Decisions

- All tax calculations are client-side only — no API calls, no user data stored
- Cookie consent required before analytics/ads load
- External links use `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- Blog posts use static routes (not dynamic `[slug]`) for maximum SSG performance
- Each calculator page is self-contained with its own tax data (no shared constants file)
- **Every page uses LayoutWrapper** — provides consistent sidebar, footer, and breadcrumbs site-wide. Pass `breadcrumbs` prop for breadcrumb navigation (omit on homepage). This includes blog posts and FAQ (previously they rendered without sidebar/footer).
- **No fake authors** — we decided against fabricated author personas. E-E-A-T is handled at the organisation level via the About page's "Our Approach" section (editorial standards, methodology, data sources).
- **About page includes editorial standards** — "How We Keep Things Accurate", "Why We Built This", and "Editorial Standards" sections establish trust for YMYL content.
- **Take-home pay calculator has no banner** — the blue header banner with logo was removed; the page starts directly with the h1. Don't re-add it.
- **Responsive grid pattern** — use `lg:` (not `md:`) for all multi-column grids site-wide, because the 230px sidebar eats into available width on iPad (768px). Specifically: `lg:grid-cols-2` for 2-column, `lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3` for progressive 3-column, `lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4` for progressive 4-column. Never use `md:grid-cols-2`.
- **Calculator form+results layout** — all calculators with a side results panel use `xl:grid-cols-3` (not `lg:`) with `xl:col-span-2` for the form and `xl:col-span-1` for results. This ensures the results panel doesn't overflow on iPad landscape (1024px). Results stack below the form until 1280px+.
- **AdUnit is self-collapsing** — the `<AdUnit />` component uses a MutationObserver watching `data-ad-status` (set by AdSense to `"filled"` or `"unfilled"`). If no ad renders, it collapses to zero height with no margin/gap. Don't add `min-h` or fixed height to it. Don't use `offsetHeight` to detect ad fill — it gives false positives.
- **AdUnit mobile scroll hint** — when an ad fills on mobile (`lg:hidden`), a "↓ Scroll down to see results" message appears above the ad so users know results are below.
- **Manual ad placements** — All 10 calculator pages have a desktop-only top ad unit (`<AdUnit slot="1586479879" hideOnMobile />`) above the h1. `/pay-rise` and `/take-home-pay-calculator` also have an in-content ad (`<AdUnit />`, default slot `7756198179`) after Advanced Options. Blog pages rely on auto ads only.
- **Side rail ad space** — LayoutWrapper uses `2xl:max-w-[1100px]` on the inner content div to leave ~200px+ on the right at 1536px+ viewports for AdSense side rail ads. Below `2xl`, content is full width. Don't remove this max-width.
- **Narrow layout for blogs** — LayoutWrapper accepts a `narrow` prop (used on all blog pages) which applies `2xl:max-w-[900px]` instead, leaving ~400px for side rail ads. The space is always present on 2xl+ screens whether an ad fills or not.

## Known Gaps / TODO
- Salary breakdown pages only cover £30k-£60k (could expand £20k-£100k)
- Tax data is duplicated across calculator files (could be centralised)
- No RSS feed
- No hreflang tags (should add `en-gb`)
- FAQ schema only on FAQ page (could be added to calculator pages for more rich results)
- No table of contents on long blog posts
- More "vs" comparison content opportunities (e.g. PAYE vs self-employed, full-time vs part-time tax)
- When adding new blog posts, update Related Reading sections on relevant calculator pages
- Blog pages have no manual `<AdUnit />` placements — should add them for better ad revenue
- `/pay-rise` and `/take-home-pay-calculator` have two ad units (top + in-content) — other calculators only have the top ad unit and could benefit from an in-content one too
